## Weather navigation

Messing about with react and mapbox, adding routing and maybe some weather data eventually.

## Installation

The application is based on create-react-app, so running "yarn" or "npm install" should be enough. In addition, a file named config.json should be placed in the src-folder. This file will contain the api-keys for Mapbox and OpenRouteService on the following format:

```json
{
  "mapboxToken": "your-key-here",
  "openRoutingToken": "your-key-here""
}
```

Then run "yarn start" or "npm start" to run the application.
